// 2 pointers
technique usually used with subarrays to optimize o(n^2) to o(n), u move with the right pointer and at a time you will stop and move the left pointer
problem:
books
subbarray sums 1

// binary search with doubles: 
use iterations and all vars are long double
// binary search on answer
problems on bs:
maximum median

// sliding window
optimze a o(n^2) to o(n) by moving on the array
problems:
max subbarray sums
