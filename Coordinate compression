size of array in any prob is about max 1e6
so if elements in that array are in a range up to 1e18 and we use partial or freq array it will memory limit
so we can compress our array such that every big element can be resized to a new value which will be maximum the size of array
steps:
1- init temp vector and push all arr elemnts
2- sort,erase using unique 
3- arr[i] = lowerbound(v.beg,v.end,v[i])-v.begin;
after these steps if you want to access the real element -> v[arr[i]]
use cord comp when values are not important and ranges will not change if values changed
